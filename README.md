# Breast-Cancer-Classification

In this project we have used back propagation algorithm and stochastic 
gradient descent for a single hidden layer network and a simple convolutional
network. We have used sigmoid activation for both networks and least squares (MSE)
as the loss function.

Type Below command to run the project on breastcancer dataset.
