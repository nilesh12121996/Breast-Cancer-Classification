# Breast-Cancer-Classification

In this project we have used back propagation algorithm and stochastic 
gradient descent for a single hidden layer network and a simple convolutional
network. We have used sigmoid activation for both networks and least squares (MSE)
as the loss function.

The input to our program is the data file and the train labels given in the datasets. 
For example to run your project on breast cancer data with trainlabels.0 and images in traindir and testdir you would type

python project1.py bc.train.0 bc.test.0 traindir testdir
